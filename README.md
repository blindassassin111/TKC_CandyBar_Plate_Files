# TKC_CandyBar_Plate_Files
Plate files for the TKC Candybar including left and right numpad as well as ortho!

Important Notes:
1) All of the plates have only their respective standoff locations shown, if you are planning to use the case with a unique pcb please design accordingly to work with the standoff locations. Failure to do so is your fault and don't blame me for you not paying attention.

2) For left and right numpad all layout options are on the plates, if it isn't supported then you have to design a PCB to do so and not all layouts are possible due to the mounting restrictions.

3) The ortho plate only has the full grid shown as there are too many variables in how one can do the layout to put all one the same plate. Before doing any modification check that the standoffs do not interfere with the changes and if a stab is needed please remember the wire must in inboard of the switches (meaning the wire can't sit along the outside edge of the PCB or it will not work at all with the candybar case).

4) There is currently no first party ortho plate, so any issues or layout discrepencies are to be taken out with the designer of those pcbs and not TKC or me. As well we will not help with what layouts will work, please do the thinking yourself as it is a lot of work on my end to check when someone asks something like this. I will ignore you and TKC has no way of checking without contacting me to check, in which case you will be ignored again.

5) The USB port is centered between the column 10 and 11 switches.

6) If you design a pcb to work with the case, please note the plate standoffs require a 4.5mm passthrough hole in the pcb and that there are pcb support pegs along the middle of the keyboard to prevent hotswap pcbs from slowly coming off the switches. These pegs need a 2.2mm hole in the pcb. All standoff locations are on the plates, the support pegs are located as follows:

- #1: 20.635mm to the right and 28.575 down from the center of the top left switch (esc on the right numpad pcb)
- #2: 117.48mm to the right of #1
- #3: 254mm to the right of #1

7) PC Candybars do not have the pcb supports and if you make your own compatible case you can ignore them if you wish, but do note to be compatible with the original candybar you must have these on the pcb.

8) Ortho is only supported on R2 and R2.1, unfortunately R1 isn't supported as the idea didn't come until around R2 running. To know if you are able to support ortho check the inside of the case for the letter 'O' marking 4 standoffs, if you only see 'L' and 'R' you have an R1 and therefore can't use ortho as one of the non-removeable standoffs prevents the layout from being possible. R2 and beyond have 4 removeable standoffs, this is another way to tell as R1 only has 3.

9) Just so you know, the screws used on the candybar are M2x0.4 and must be button head or low profile in order for caps not to hit them when depressed. If you buy replacements for your case this is a very important thing to watch out for.
